Use the perl script 'caldb_write_and_link_EC_pedestals.pl' to load EC pedestals
into the calibration database.  

usage:
caldb_write_and_link_EC_pedestals.pl  f=<file with constants> ci=<comment for run index>\
    min=<run min> max=<run max> [srmin=<source run min>] [srmax=<source runmax>]\
    [cv=<comment for item value table>] [it=<run index table name>] [user=<MySQL user name>] \

Other files:

load_EC_PEDESTALS - short script for calling caldb_write_and_link_EC_pedestals.pl

example - example of short script for loading multiple pedestal runs. Calls load_EC_PEDESTALS.
Also this file provides a hard copy record of what was loaded.

ec.trans_clasprod_0xxxxx.txt - contains pedestal values for run xxxxx.  These files are located
on the CLON cluster under $CLON_PARMS/pedman/Tfiles and must be copied to the JLAB machines in 
the same directory as caldb_write_and_link_EC_pedestals.pl 

Notes: 

1) Make sure <run min> and <run max> are appropriate when loading pedestals for run xxxxx.
Basically <run min>=xxxxx <run max>=yyyyy-1, where yyyyy is the run number of the next pedestal 
run following xxxxx.

2) After loading pedestals verify that the database was updated using the web page:
