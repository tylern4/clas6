Executable name "fsgen", can be made by typing "make" in the
directory where source files are. Works the same way as the
rest of the CLAS software packages.

To run "fsgen", files "fsgen_input", "lund_upd.dat" and "celeg.ddl"
should be present in the working directory. The running conditions
are defined in "fsgen_input".

Particle ID scheme is PDG, for decay channels JETSET is used.
For light nuclei (2H, 3He, 4He, 3H) GEAN PID is used.

Output bos banks are MCTK, MCVX, HEAD, TAGR (if flag is set).

Most of explanations are given in the "fsgen_input".

File "lund_upd.dat" can be used to insert new particles.
