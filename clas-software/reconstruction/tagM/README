tagM package
D. Lawrence 11/12/01


This package is used to create the TAGM bank from information in
the recently added (summer 2001) T-counter Multi-hit TDCs in the
TAGE crate. Having multiple hits and a larger time range make these
better suited for tagger rate calculations than the high resolution,
single-hit 1872 TDC's.

The structure here is pretty straight forward (I hope!). There are
three top level routines:

tagM_init() which does nothing right now
tagM_brun() which reads in all the needed calibration constants
tagM_evt()  which should be called from the event loop to produce
            the TAGM bank.


The other files:

tagM_GetECounterHits.c    tagM_GetTCounterHits.c
tagM_GetETCoincidences.c  tagM_GetEChannelHits.c
tagM_GetTChannelHits.c    tagM_make_TAGM.c

all contain routines called from tagM_evt.c


These is also an include file tagM.h which lives in the include 
directory.

note on map/caldb entries
Ji Li 5/22/2002

2 new entries corresponding to TAGM package were added in TAG_CALIB.map:

Sybsystem	Item

tag_e		2t
tag_t		dt_multihit

as of now(5/22/2002), the calibration procedure for these entries are being developed.
