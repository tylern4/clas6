This is the Fortran program for processing the output from the MAID
generator aao_rad so that the free nucleon events are used to model
scattering processes off a nucleon bound inside deuteron.  It may turn
out to be impossible to build this outside JLAB computers as it will
likely depend on the class make system and the various include files
located in e.g.

/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages

such as bcs.inc.
