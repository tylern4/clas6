mir = 10000 is overprecise
1000 still have 1% precision but run much faster
mir means minimum number of subdivisions
OT = precision - right now 1%

ma=100000?

mir = 4th argument of d01fce:
integer minimum number of integrand values to be allowed, which must not exceed maxpts (fifth argument)

ma  = 5th argument of d01fce: integer maximum number of integrand values to be allowed, which must be at least
      2**ndim+2*ndim**2+2*ndim+1.  ndim is 3 in exclurad

make.rules defective: it wants to link with g++ - just copy and paste make env
with g77




table reading:

for SAID2008, mpintp has to be modified (Q2max=4)
I also modified exclurad.f at line 4429, to read in format "*" instead of FMT=15



added the external file 

multipole_amps.F  that will also extrapolate multipoles for q2 greater than 5
