The old directory contains the command line input version
of elast_gen.  I prefer flat files for fortran since the
success of cc language wrappers is strongly platform
dependent.

There was no sconstruct or Makefile present in the directory. This code was
compiled for x86_64 using the 32bit standard environment using scons by
issuing the command

$ scons alignbits=32

I had to modify the bos_end.F function to comment out a non-critical command
that spits errors during compiling.

The code runs fine on x86_64 machines in 64bit environment as well. Couldn't
get the C wrapper working.
