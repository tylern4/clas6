Hi all,
  I checked in a new program called 'spp_int_e1' under
packages/aao/. To use this program, you also
need tables in /group/clas/parms/spp_tbl/. 

The features of this program are as follow:

1. Calculate the cross section of the single pion electroproduction
   using 5 different physics models.

2. Average the cross section of the single pion electroproduction
   for a given bin size or integrate over phi, theta or W .

Details of each model: 

 A. maid98 (D. Drechsel, O. Hanstein, S.S. Kamalov and L. Tiator)
   1. It is based on a unitary isobar model for Pion Photo- and 
      Electroproduction on the Proton. Refer details to 
      Nucl. Phys. A645 (1999) 145-174  

   2. 1.3M tables for E(L+/-), S(L+/-) and M(L+/-) multipoles 
      were downloded from http://www.kph.uni-mainz.de/MAID/
	  using a program, wget and retabulated for each channel.
	  The Grid size of these tables is 0.05 GeV^2 in Q2 
      and 0.01 GeV in W.
  
   3. You can calculate cross section for 
      e + p -> e + p + pi0  
      e + n -> e + p + pi- 
      e + p -> e + n + pi+

   4. You can calculate cross section with/without 
      each resonance and background.
      (born, rho, omega, P33, P11, D13, S11(1535), S11(1635),
       f15, D33)

   5. Q2: 0.00 - 4.00 (GeV^2)
      W : 1.10 - 1.70 (GeV)

   6. It calculates CGLN amplitudes and then converts them to 
      helicity amplitudes so that you can easily extend 
      this program for other observables such as polarization observables. 
      It will be good for eg1 experiments.

   7. You can choose cubic spline fitting or linear spline fitting
      to interpolate each multipole value. Linear fitting is faster, but
      cubic spline fitting is more accurate. The difference between them
      is about less than 1 %. You can also choose highest angular momentum.
      It can go up L=5.
      
 (2) maid2000  (D. Drechsel, O. Hanstein, S.S. Kamalov and L. Tiator)
   This model is the extension of maid98.
   W can go up to 2.0 GeV.

 (3) Harry Lee Calculation
   1. For details of this model, refer to Nucl. Phys. A513(1990)511.

   2. Program structure is the same as maid98.
 
   3. It currently calculates only e + p -> e + p + pi0, but
      as soon as H. Lee sends new tables for other channels, I
      will update it.

   4. Q2: 0.00 - 4.00 (GeV^2)
      W : 1.10 - 1.35 (GeV)

 (4) A0 model (V. Burkert and Z. Li)
   1. Fitting of world data

   2. It calculates 
      e + p -> e + p + pi0    
      e + p -> e + n + pi+

   3. Q2: 0.00 - 4.00 or higher(?) (GeV^2)
      W : 1.10 - 2.00 or higher(?) (GeV)

 (5)  Latham's parameterization
   1. It used parameterization from Daresbury data
      and dipole form factors for Q2 dependence.

   2. W: 1.1 - 1.3 (GeV)

If you have questions or find bugs, please let me know.
