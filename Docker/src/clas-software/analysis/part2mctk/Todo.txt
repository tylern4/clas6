- Fix electron handling for MCTK input

- Investigate why e.g. proton & pi- four vector product is not
  conserved after smearing

- Write script which runs full simulation stack with output location
  as argument.

- Test with output from aao_rad.

- Fix mass handling.  Need to put ideal mass of particle in the ouput,
  not from the four vectors.  It causes problems with electrons
  especially, but could potentially cause problems with gsim/GEANT.

- Switch from command line arguments to stdin; that way input files
  can be written.  Should allow comments in the input files.
