* Have a flag for outputting the spectator particle as well as the
  interacting nucleon.

* Check deuteron mass for presence of electron mass.  Shouldn't be
  there for our purposes, but it may be there in the referenced
  measurements.

* E = m - 1 MeV.  Since md = Ep + En, we simply split the binding
  energy in deuteron equally among the nucleons.

* Use MCTK bank in output in all cases.  gsim needs an extra flag set
  if the input to gsim is from the PART bank.

* bcs.inc and likely other include files are located under

  /group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages/include/

  and these are necessary for building BOS software and likely FPACK
  software as well.

  The CLAS make system makefile is located under $CLAS_CMS/Makefile,
  where at the moment

  CLAS_CMS=/group/clas/builds/PRODUCTION/packages/cms/

  which means that the CMS Makefile adds flags like

  '-I $(CLAS_CMS)/../include/'

  to its gfortran compiler calls for compiling targets.
