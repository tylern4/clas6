<h1>tdc_calib: calculate TDC calibration constants for SC_CALIBRATIONS</h1>

<p> Rewriting of the TDC calibration routine became necessary, because the
existing program was unable to handle runs bigger than 2 GeV (split into
several physical bosfiles). Other than the program used before, the tdc_calib is
specialized in calculating the TDC calibration especially for the
SC_CALIBRATION. It uses the ROOT environment for doing the actual fit as well as for
monitoring the results. 

<h3> Usage </h3>
<pre>
   tdc_calib [-options] &lt;inputfile1&gt; [&lt;inputfile2&gt; ...] &lt;br&gt;

Options:

   -r &lt;file&gt;        write root histograms to &lt;file&gt;       [D=no hist]

   -d &lt;directory&gt;   write calibration constants to &lt;dir&gt;  [D=current]

   -h               show commandline options

</pre>
<p>
tdc_calib needs one special pulser run to calculate the TDC calibration
constants. One run comprises usually 9GB data, therefore a list of physical
filenames is needed. You can use all kind of
wildcards, which are expanded to valid filenames by the shell. <p>

The recommended way in passing an additional file/directory option to
tdc_calib is including a blank 
between the option and the argument. The program understands the -dDirectory
notation as well, however, the shell is unable to expand special character
like leading ~ then.</p>

<h3> Running </h3>
<img src=tdc_calib_running.gif> <p>
For each channel, 175 different delay time settings between TDC start and stop and
four different masks (each mask includes only one TDC channel out of four) 1000 pulser
events are taken. If there are enough TDC entries for a given channel, a Gauss
fit routine extracts the mean value and the error and some additional information
to survey the quality of the fit (like chi-square, sigma, area under
curve...). A value of 2 in the histogram above indicates, that the fit has
been rejected by the program. If there are only few values sorted out, there is
nothing to worry about. If there is no entry (value=0), no TDC values in the
valid range has been found. </p>

<h3> Checking Histograms </h3>

<td width=85% valign=top>
<b> gs0 - gs5 </b> Some 2D histograms to survey the quality of the gauss
fits. Use the ROOT drag and drop features to set a range for the Z-axis, if
the default is not convenient.<br><br>
<b> T0 - T2 </b> The results for the calibration constants. Use the button <b>
toggle L/R </b> to toggle between the values for the left and right TDC. This
option button works for other histograms as well.<br><br>
<b> Option: raw histo, show fit, 2deg par </b> This buttons are radio-buttons,
only one of this options is active at any time. It affects the presentation of
the sector overview as well as the single channel display. The <b> raw histo </b>
option shows the original TDC entries, the <b> show fit </b> the second degree
polynomial fit through the gauss fit results. Choose the <b> 2deg par </b>
option to see the deviation from the linear fit enlarged. In these graphs, the
linear and constant component are subtracted from the points.<br><br>
<b> Single channel </b> This button opens a sub-menu with one button for each
channel. One might consider, to make the sector overview histograms clickable,
to get a more intuitive access to single channels in future program
versions. However, to do so could interfere with the generic ROOT event
handler and has be considered to be to dangerous.<br><br>
<b> Write file </b> The resulting constants as well as their errors are
written to files using an unambiguous naming convention like T1lerr.dat . If no
option -d is given, the files will be written to the current directory.<br><br>
<b> Write caldb </b> If you think, it is not convenient to write and link 12
sets of constants manually to the caldb database server, try this graphical
interface. You have to be database officer, to write the new constants to the
common RunIndex, but writing to a private RunIndex works as well.
After filling the check-in form, it uses the traditional perl
script caldb_write_and_link to perform the database update. The output from the perl script is
shown in a new popup window.<br><br>
