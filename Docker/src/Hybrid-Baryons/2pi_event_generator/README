Generator is exclusive and electroproduction (but at low Q2 it uses photoproduction data as limiting point). It works for all Q2 starting from very small (0.005 GeV^2) and W from the threshold to 3 GeV.

The generator works in the following way: firstly, it generates phase space (flat) distributions and then for each event multidimensional cross section is applied as a weight. 

The generator produces output in lund format with minor changes:  in the Header in field 6* instead of "x" I put event number, and in field 10* instead of "nu" I put the cross section value.  (see also this slide https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/images/d/dc/Hybrid_Jan15_2016.pdf )

The generator also makes .BOS output that is compatible with CLAS6 reconstruction procedure and .root output with some histograms for test purposes. 

The generator includes radiative effects according to Mo&Tsai. It also includes fermi-smearing if needed.

--------------------------------------------------
The code includes rather big amount of files, but the major part of them corresponds to the interpolation/extrapolation procedures for the cross section calculation (all files with names get_xsect* and interpol*).

The key files are:

main_prog.cxx - the main program.

inp_file_read.cxx - reading information from the input file

read_xsect_files.cxx - reading files with cross sections from the corresponding directories 

out_file_open.cxx, out_file_fill.cxx, out_file_close.cxx - needed to open fill and close output files correspondingly.

anti_rot.cxx - contains the subroutine that calculates the 4-vectors of all final particles in the lab frame from  W, Q2 and hadron variables generated in the CMS.

rot.cxx - contains the subroutine that calculates hadron variables in the CMS from their 4-vectors in the lab frame.

radcorr.cxx - performs radiative effects.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two compiling options: 

"make nobos" - to compile without BOS libraries, no output in BOS format is possible in this case.
"make bos" - to compile with BOS libraries. BOS output can be created according to the flag in the input file. Some of the libraries are located at "/u/home/gleb/lib/LinuxRHFC8" and sooner or later they will become irrelevant.

------------------------------------------------
It should compile on the ifarms.

to run it type "./twopeg_bos < inp1" or "./twopeg_nobos < inp1" depending on the compiling options.

inp1 is in the same directory and contains input parameters with comments. 

--------------------------------------------------
The generator needs .dat files with tabulated structure functions and fit parameters. They are located in the "data" subfolder inside the EG directory. If you move it, you need to define environment variable "data_dir_2pi" that points to the new folder location (for example in csh use "setenv data_dir_2pi new_path/").
